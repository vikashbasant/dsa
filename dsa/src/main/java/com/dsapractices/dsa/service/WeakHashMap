WeakHashmap:
1. It is exactly same as hashMap, except the following differences:
    1. In the case of hashMap, even though object does not have any reference, it not eligible for gc().
    If it is associated with hashMap that is hashMap dominate garbage collector.

    2. But in the case of WeakHashMap, if object doesn't contains any reference, it is eligible for gc().
    Even though object associated with WeakHashMap. that is garbage collector dominate WeakHashMap.
