//=============================: HashMap:=========================//
1. Every method present in HashMap is not Synchronized.
2. At every time HashMap Object multiple thread are allow to operate(that why it is not thread safe)
3. To operate on HashMap Object, thread are not required to wait(that why relatively performance is high).
4. In HashMap (null as a key & null as a value) is allow.
5. HashMap is not legacy( It is introduced in 1.2v)

//============================: Hashtable:===========================//
1. Every method present in HashMap is Synchronizer.
2. At every time Hashtable Object only one thread are allow to operate(that why it is thread safe).
3. To operate on Hashtable Object, thread are required to wait(that why relatively performance is low).
4. In Hashtable (null as a key & null as a value) is not allow(otherwise we will get NPE(NullPointerException)).
5. Hashtable is legacy(It is introduced in 1.0v)


# How to get Synchronized version of HashMap:
HashMap m = new HashMap();
Map m1 = Collections.synchronizedMap(m);
where
    m: Non-Synchronized
    m1: Synchronized
