1. Identity HashMap, It is exactly same as HashMap(including methods and constructor)
except the following differences:
    1. In the case of normal hashmap, JVM will used .equals() methods to identify duplicate keys,
    which is meant for content comparison.

    2. But in the case of identityHashMap, JVm will used == operators to identify duplicate keys,
    which is meant for reference comparison(address comparison).
